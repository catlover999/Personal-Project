# Personal-Project
Dear future employer.
This Repo contains my first middle-school python project and in no way represents my current programming abilities. For this project, I taught myself basic python based on different tutorials and along the way probably violated a few dozen best practices/conventions. Nothing in this project works and will forever remain incomplete. I am keeping this up as a marker of how far I have come from where I started.
